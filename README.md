## University of Chicago, Econ PhD Program, 3rd year seminar, replication assignment
**Paper:** Prudential Monetary Policy, Caballero and Simsek, 2020  
**Status:** I replicated figures 3 through 8 in the paper  
**Goal:** Extend the paper in line with my 3rd year paper idea  
  
- The code is written in Julia.
- Main.jl runs the code.
- The folder "figures" holds all replicated figures.
- The folder "tmp" holds converged value functions with respect to different parameter values. In particular, the first number represents leverage limit, while the second represents planner's belief.
